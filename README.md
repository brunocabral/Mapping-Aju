# Mapping Aju - Mapping the public bus transportation network of Aracaju, Brazil. Mapeando a rede de transporte público de ônibus de Aracaju

## Motivation

The public bus transportation network has a great importance in the routine of the major part of the inhabitants of Aracaju-SE, Brazil,
However, the mobility inside the network is cloudy for those whom has no knowledge of the bus lines' routes,

"I've got to go the Praça da Bandeira (Flag Square), which options of bus lines do I have to get there from where I am now?"

With this project I hope that this kind of question could be answered easier. I believe that with the entire bus network mapped, the development of news apps about public transportation in the city would be easier, besides the possibity of generate a graphical map of the entire network [Ex.:Mapa da Rede de Transporte Público de Dublin, Irlanda](http://i.imgur.com/BHPf7.gif), making easier the lives of the users, whom will be able to visualize the connections between the lines around the city.
